            My Favorite City: Houston, Texas
        </h2>
        <p>
            Houston is my favorite city mostly because of its varied entertainment offerings. I spend most of my
            time
            holed
            up at my house, really only entertaining myself with any place within walking distance, so it's nice
            having
            somewhere nearby that's a little more of a car ride away that offers a more varied options pool.
            (personally,
            I'm a big fan of the zoo)
