        <p>Hello! my name is Ryan Bradley and I am from Spring, Texas. My hobbies mainly include video games, writing,
            and tabletop game development. I've been kind of on again off again working on this bigger project with my
            little brother called "Cursed Chest"! Ooooohhhhh~~~!!!

            I live in the state of Texas, a US state popularly represented with cowboy-esque imagery and being
            constantly under attack by sweltering heat. Did you know that the horns of the Texas Longhorn can span
            more than 8 feet from tip to tip?
